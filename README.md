## Description

This is a command line application that allows managers to interact with an SQL databse of products, tags, and categories through CRUD API routes. 

This application provides a functional Express.js API. When you add your database name, MYSQL username, and MYSQL password, then you can connect with your database using Sequelize. You may create a development database and seed it with test data by entering schema and seed commands (type "npm run seed" into the command line), then connect to it by typing "npm start" in the command line.

Once you are connected to the database, you can then interact with it through API routes. Categories, products, and tags each have functional API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE ROUTES. When you open GET routes in Insomnia Core you are presented with each in a formatted JSON.
